## Part 1

### User Story 1

```md

#### Routes 1

- `/` (index)
- `/add`

#### Services 1

- addPeep
- getAllPeeps

### Testing 1

## Part 2

### User Story 2

```md
As a trainee
So that I can see what others are saying
I want to see all peeps in reverse chronological order
```

### Initial Thoughts 2

- You don't have to be logged in to see peeps
- Create a Date object when a peep is posted
- Front-end
- Reverse chronological: newest first
- Want the home page to look like this (Search Bar and Trends optional)
  ![twitter mock-up](images/twitter-homepage-mockup.jpeg)
- Use CSS/bootstrap to add design to the page

### Components 2

- Homepage
  - Navbar (Logo, Home Link, Compose Peep Link, Profile Link, Login/Register Link)
  - Feed

### Tests 2

Sidebar Component Testing

**Test 6** - Sidebar matches snapshot

Feed Component Testing

**Test 7** - Should render "Peeps Loading" on initial render

**Test 8** - Should render "No Peeps" if empty array returned from server

**Test 9** - getPeeps makes the external data call

**Test 10** - a successful request returns the right data

**Test 11** - an unsuccessful request returns the error object

**Test 12** - an empty request returns an error message

**Test 13** - should render "Peeps are loading" on initial render

**Test 14** - should render "no data" message when an error is returned
